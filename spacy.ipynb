To the shores of need Past the reefs of greed Through the squalls of hate Sail on, sail on, sail on  It's coming to America first  The cradle of the best and of the worst It's here they've got the range And the machinery for change And it's here they've got the spiritual thirst It's here the family's broken And it's here the lonely say That the heart has got to open In a fundamental way Democracy is coming to the USA  It's coming from the women and the men Oh baby, we'll be making love again We'll be going down so deep That the river's going to weep And the mountain's going to shout Amen! It's coming like the tidal flood Beneath the lunar sway Imperial, mysterious  In amorous array Democracy is coming to the USA  Sail on, sail on Oh mighty ship of state! To the shores of need Past the reefs of greed Through the squalls of hate Sail on, sail on, sail on  I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean Oh, I love the country but I can't stand the scene And I'm neither left or right I'm just staying home tonight Getting lost in that hopeless little screen But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags That time cannot decay I'm junk but I'm still holding up  This little wild bouquet Democracy is coming to the USA To the USA To the USA To the USA\",\n",
