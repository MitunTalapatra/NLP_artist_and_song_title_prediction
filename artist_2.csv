To make your time more easy passing  Oh how can, how can you ask me again? What only brings me sorrow The same thing I would want today I would want again tomorrow  I got a letter on a lonesome day It was from her ship a-sailing Saying I don't know when I'll be coming back again It depends on how I'm feeling  Well if you, my love, must think that way And I'm sure your mind is roaming And I'm sure your heart is not with me But with the country to where you're going  So take heed, take heed of the western wind And take heed of the stormy weather And yes, there's something you can send back to me Spanish boots of Spanish leather",The Lumineers
